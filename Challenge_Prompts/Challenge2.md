# Challenge 2: Contextualizing COLREGs Interactions

COLREGs are complicated and multifactorial. In order to develop context for COLREGs interactions, there are a lot of variables that need to be considered. 
First, the type of encounter: overtaking, crossing, or meeting. 

Second, COLREGs apply different standards to vessels in restricted waters such as narrow channels, and traffic separation schemes, and large vessels that are restricted in their ability to maneuver. Understanding this context requires linking the AIS data to Electronic Navigational Chart data. 
Third, vessels have different hierarchies depending on the situation. Powered vessels must give way to sailing vessels, which must give way to vessels engaged in fishing, except under certain circumstances. Modeling ships behavior requires knowing the type of vessel and what it is doing during the encounter. There are several good websites for discovering vessel details including https://www.marinetraffic.com/. The shipâ€™s activity can be inferred from AIS data or observing the ships behavior.   
The USCG COLREGs Quick Reference as well as a compete COLREGs may be helpful as references. 

We have a sample dataset of COLREGs interactions available at XXXX. You will get extra points for using the results of challenge 1 as your inputs into challenge 2. The judging criteria for the challenge will include: 
- Model completeness and applicability: 50 points: Developing techniques for filling in missing AIS data or adding variables
- The number of encounters modeled: 30 points: Points will be awarded based on the different types of interactions you are able to contextualize.
- Presentation and visualization: 20 points
